Catalog files
=============

This directory contains the files necessary to build the PRM documents
provided here.

Under RISC OS, you should set XML$CatalogFiles to point to the root/xml
file.
Under Linux, you should set XML_CATALOG_FILES to point to the root.xml
file.

Documentation can be found in the docs directory:

    - docs/PRMinXML.txt - documents the elements and usage of the PRM-in-XML format.
    - docs/BNF.txt - documents the BNF elements which can be used by PRM-in-XML.
    - docs/HowTo.md - describes how you can use the tool and build documentation.

A skeleton PRM-in-XML document can be found in gerph/skeleton.xml.
