<section title="Introduction">
<p>
This section is a brief introduction to what the component does.
</p>

<subsection title="About this skeleton">
<p>The examples given in this example are not comprehensive -
   consult the documentation for more details.</p>
<p>The sections which contain '-definition' elements usually do not have an introductory
    text section. Any explanation of how they fit together should be placed into these
    preceding sections - mostly in the Overview and Technical Details sections.
</p>
</subsection>

<p>Each section can have subsections in its body to split things into groups.</p>

        <category title="Category title">
            <p>'category' is not a 'sub-sub-sub-section' for a few reasons:
                <list>
                    <item>It's a bit of a mouthful</item>
                    <item>It is used in the PRM to break up blocks of text into alternative topics (rather than to introduce new topics which is what the subsections do)</item>
                    <item>It is horizontally aligned with the body text, which reinforces its use in not breaking into new topics, which the outdented sections do. (Presentational details may change in future presentations of these documents).

<section title="Overview">
<p>An overview of how the component is viewed by the outside world;
   what it does and the manner in which it does it.
</p>
<p>Sometimes the Introduction and the Overview are joined to make 'Introduction and
   Overview'.</p>
</section>


<section title="Terminology">
<p>
Any terminology specific to this chapter which is assumed knowledge
for readers. Most components do not require the terms to be defined.
</p>
</section>


<section title="Technical details">
<p>
Technical details about how to operate the component; this is usually
the largest section and fleshes out the summaries described above
and in the following sections with the 'whys', the 'hows' and the
specifics on the usage. Usually this section includes some of the
details about data structures.
</p>
</section>

<section title="VDU codes">
<p>
Lists the VDU codes, using vdu-definition, which are provided by
this component. This is a specialised section unlikely to be needed
by most components.
</p>

<vdu-definition name="1"
                description="Next character to printer only"
                >
<syntax>VDU 1,<userreplace>character</userreplace> </syntax>

<parameter name="character">to send to the printer stream</parameter>
<use>
<p>VDU 1 sends the next character to the printer stream only, provided that
the printer has been enabled by VDU 2. Otherwise, the next character is
ignored. This enables the printer ignore character, and any other character
which is not usually passed on by the VDU printer driver, to be sent to the
printer through the VDU.</p>
</use>

<example>
<p>
<code type="basic">VDU 1,10</code><br />
Send a linefeed to the printer stream, if enabled
</p>
</example>
</vdu-definition>
</section>
