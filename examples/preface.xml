<p>
    This document is intended to give examples of what each element and style
    looks like when generated by the PRM-in-XML tool. If there are problems with
    any given element, style, or structure, we should include an example in
    these documents to demonstrate its use.
</p>

<p>
    This chapter demonstrates its use as a 'preface' chapter, before the main
    chapters start.
